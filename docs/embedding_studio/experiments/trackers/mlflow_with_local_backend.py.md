## Documentation for `ExperimentsManagerWithLocalFileSystem`

### Functionality
The `ExperimentsManagerWithLocalFileSystem` class serves as a wrapper over the MLflow package to manage fine-tuning experiments using a local file system backend. It extends `ExperimentsManager` to add local artifact management and deletion capabilities with a retry policy for robustness. The class allows for tracking and managing fine-tuning experiments while facilitating local operations, such as the deletion of model files.

### Parameters
- `tracking_uri` (str): URL of the MLflow server.
- `main_metric` (str): Primary metric name for evaluating models.
- `plugin_name` (str): Fine-tuning method identifier.
- `accumulators` (list): List of MetricsAccumulator instances for logging metrics.
- `is_loss` (bool): Boolean flag indicating if the main metric represents loss.
- `n_top_runs` (int): Number of top runs to consider in further tuning steps.
- `requirements` (str): Additional requirements for model logging.
- `retry_config`: Configuration for retrying failed operations.

### Inheritance
Inherits from `ExperimentsManager` to reuse core experiment management functionality while adding local file system support.

### Method: `_delete_model`
This method deletes model files associated with a given run. It retrieves the artifact URI from MLflow and uses the LocalArtifactRepository to remove all related files from the local file system.

#### Parameters
- `run_id` (str): Identifier of the run whose model files will be deleted.
- `experiment_id` (str): Identifier of the experiment to which the run belongs.

### Usage
- **Purpose**: Clean up local model files after an experiment run, freeing disk space and managing storage.

### Example
Create an instance of `ExperimentsManagerWithLocalFileSystem` to manage an experiment with local storage:

```python
experiments_manager = ExperimentsManagerWithLocalFileSystem(
    tracking_uri="http://localhost:5000",
    main_metric="accuracy",
    plugin_name="finetune",
    accumulators=[accumulator1, accumulator2],
    is_loss=False,
    n_top_runs=10,
    requirements="torch>=1.7.1",
    retry_config=your_retry_config
)

result = experiments_manager._delete_model(
    "some_run_id", "some_experiment_id"
)
if result:
    print("Model files deleted successfully.")
else:
    print("Model file deletion failed.")
```
