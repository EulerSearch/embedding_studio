# Documentation for ItemsSetAugmentationApplier

## Overview

The `ItemsSetAugmentationApplier` class is designed to enhance dataset diversity by applying a specified augmentation strategy to items within an `ItemsSet`. The class facilitates the generation of augmented examples that can be merged with the original dataset for further training or evaluation.

### Functionality

The class provides two primary methods:

1. **_augment**: This method applies the augmentation transform to each item in the provided `ItemsSet`. It iterates through every item, utilizes the specified augmentation's transform method on the item's field, and yields a dictionary containing the original ID alongside the generated augmented item.

2. **apply_augmentation**: This method applies an augmentation on an `ItemsSet` instance and returns a new `ItemsSet` that includes both the original and the augmented items. The augmentation is executed using a transformation defined by `AugmentationWithRandomSelection`.

### Parameters

- **augmentation**: An instance of `AugmentationWithRandomSelection` that defines the transformation applied to each item.
- **items_set**: An `ItemsSet` instance containing the original items. It must have the attributes: `data`, `item_field_name`, and `id_field_name` for proper mapping and processing.

### Usage

- **Purpose**: The primary purpose of the `ItemsSetAugmentationApplier` class is to generate additional examples, thereby enhancing the dataset's diversity for training or evaluation purposes.

#### Examples

**Using _augment method**:

```python
augmentation = AugmentationWithRandomSelection(...)
applier = ItemsSetAugmentationApplier(augmentation)
augmented_items = list(applier._augment(items_set))
```

**Using apply_augmentation method**:

```python
applier = ItemsSetAugmentationApplier(augmentation)
new_items_set = applier.apply_augmentation(items_set)
``` 

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the `ItemsSetAugmentationApplier` class, detailing its functionality, parameters, purpose, and usage examples for effective application in data augmentation contexts.
