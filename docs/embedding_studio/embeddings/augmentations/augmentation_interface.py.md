# Documentation for `AugmentationInterface`

## Overview

The `AugmentationInterface` is an abstract class that defines a blueprint for single augmentation methods that transform an input object into a list of augmented objects. Utilizing the Python abstract base class (ABC) module, it requires any subclass to implement the `transform` method. The primary aim of this interface is to provide a common framework for augmentation strategies, standardizing transformations to be applied uniformly across the project. This approach facilitates experimentation with different augmentation methods without altering other code components.

## Functionality

The `transform` method must be defined in any subclass, and it is responsible for transforming an input object into a list of augmented objects.

### Parameters

- `object`: The input object used for augmentation. Any type is allowed.

### Return Value

- A list of objects representing the augmented results of the input.

### Usage

- **Purpose**: To serve as a blueprint for augmenting objects within the application.

### Inheritance

`AugmentationInterface` inherits from Python's ABC, enforcing all implementations to override the abstract `transform` method. This ensures consistent behavior across various augmenters.

### Example Implementation

A simple implementation of the `transform` method might look like this:

```python
def transform(self, object: Any) -> List[Any]:
    # A simple example duplicating the input object
    return [object, object]
```
