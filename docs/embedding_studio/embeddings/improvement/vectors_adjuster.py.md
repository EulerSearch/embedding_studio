# VectorsAdjuster Class Documentation

## Overview
The VectorsAdjuster class provides an abstract interface to adjust embedding vectors using improvement input data. It defines an abstract method, `adjust_vectors`, which must be implemented by subclasses. The primary functionality of the method is to move clicked item vectors closer to a query vector while shifting non-clicked ones further away.

## Functionality
The `adjust_vectors` method adjusts embedding vectors in `ImprovementInput` objects, refining the vectors based on user click data.

### Parameters
- `data_for_improvement`: A list of `ImprovementInput` objects containing a query vector along with clicked and non-clicked elements and their corresponding embedding vectors.

### Returns
- A list of `ImprovementInput` objects with updated embedding vectors.

### Usage
- **Purpose**: Refine embedding vectors based on user click data to enhance search and recommendation systems.

### Example Implementations
#### Custom Implementation
```python
class CustomVectorsAdjuster(VectorsAdjuster):
    def adjust_vectors(self, data_for_improvement):
        # Adjust vectors by moving clicked items closer and
        # non-clicked items further away from the query vector
        for input_data in data_for_improvement:
            # Insert custom adjustment logic here
            pass
        return data_for_improvement
```

#### Simple Implementation
```python
class SimpleVectorsAdjuster(VectorsAdjuster):
    def adjust_vectors(self, data_for_improvement):
        # Example: move clicked items closer and non-clicked items farther
        return data_for_improvement
```

## Inheritance
The VectorsAdjuster class inherits from Python's ABC class, marking it as an abstract class. This enforces that any concrete subclass must provide an implementation for the `adjust_vectors` method.

## Motivation
The class is designed to standardize the process of vector adjustment in embedding-based search and recommendation systems. By providing a clear interface, VectorsAdjuster drives consistent and effective improvement strategies across various implementations.
