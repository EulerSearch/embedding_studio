## Documentation for `MaxAggregator`

### Functionality
This class computes the maximum value from a list of rank scores. It is designed to aggregate ranks by selecting the highest value provided. Additionally, it includes a differentiable method to facilitate gradient-based training.

### Motivation
In ranking tasks, the maximum score often indicates the best candidate. This class encapsulates the logic to find the maximum and offers a differentiable version to ensure gradient flow during model training.

### Inheritance
MaxAggregator inherits from the base class RanksAggregator.

### Parameters
- **if_empty_value**: A fallback value returned when no ranks are provided.

### Usage
Initialize the aggregator with an optional if_empty_value. Then, call its aggregate methods with a list or tensor of ranks.

#### Example
```python
aggregator = MaxAggregator(if_empty_value=0.0)
result = aggregator._aggregate([0.2, 0.8, 0.5])  # returns 0.8
```

## Documentation for MaxAggregator._aggregate

### Functionality
Evaluates the maximum rank from a list or tensor of ranks. If the ranks container is empty, it returns a configurable default value.

### Parameters
- **ranks**: A list of floats or a torch.Tensor of ranks.

### Usage
- **Purpose**: Extracts the highest rank from the provided set, using a default when no ranks are present.

#### Example
```python
aggregator = MaxAggregator(if_empty_value=0.0)
result = aggregator._aggregate(ranks)
```

## Documentation for MaxAggregator._aggregate_differentiable

### Functionality
Calculates the differentiable maximum value from a tensor of ranks. It uses differentiable_extreme to ensure gradient flow during training, making it suitable for backpropagation.

### Parameters
- **ranks**: A tensor of rank values. The function computes the differentiable maximum from these values.

### Usage
- **Purpose**: Compute the maximum rank in a differentiable way, preserving gradient computations during model training.

#### Example
```python
import torch
from embedding_studio.embeddings.features.ranks_aggregators.max_aggregator import MaxAggregator

# Create an instance of MaxAggregator
aggregator = MaxAggregator(if_empty_value=0.0)
ranks = torch.tensor([0.2, 0.5, 0.3])
result = aggregator._aggregate_differentiable(ranks)
print(result)
```
