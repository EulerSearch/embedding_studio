## Documentation for `PgsqlImageLoader`

### Overview
`PgsqlImageLoader` is a specialized loader designed to fetch images from a PostgreSQL database and convert binary image data into PIL Image objects. This class extends `PgsqlDataLoader`, reusing connection and query generation logic while adding dedicated handling for image data. 

### Inheritance
`PgsqlImageLoader` inherits from `PgsqlDataLoader`, which provides robust SQL query capabilities and connection management. By building on this foundation, `PgsqlImageLoader` facilitates image-specific conversions, simplifying the process of working with images stored as binary data.

### Motivation
Images stored as binary data in databases require conversion to usable formats. `PgsqlImageLoader` streamlines this process by transforming binary data into PIL Image objects, which benefits image processing and machine learning (ML) pipelines.

### Initialization
To use `PgsqlImageLoader`, initialize it with a PostgreSQL connection string, a query generator, and optionally, the name of the image column to customize its functionality.

#### Example
```python
loader = PgsqlImageLoader("postgresql://user:pass@host/db", QueryGenerator, image_column="img_data")
```

### Method: `_get_item`

#### Functionality
The `_get_item` method converts binary image data from a dictionary row into a PIL Image object. It expects the image data to be present under the key defined by the `image_column` attribute. If the image data is missing, the method logs an error and raises a `ValueError`.

#### Parameters
- `data`: A dictionary representing a row from the database, which should include image data under the key specified by `image_column`.

#### Usage
- **Purpose**: To convert raw binary image data into a PIL Image object for further processing.

#### Example
```python
row = {'image_data': binary_data}
image = loader._get_item(row)
```
