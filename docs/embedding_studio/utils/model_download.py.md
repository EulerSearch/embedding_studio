## Documentation for `ModelDownloader`

### Class Overview

`ModelDownloader` is a utility class designed for downloading models with integrated retry logic. It utilizes a provided download function while managing transient network failures, logging attempts and errors to ensure robustness during model retrieval.

### Functionality

The primary function of `ModelDownloader` is to encapsulate the model downloading process, handling temporary failures through retry management. It allows users to retrieve models consistently, even in the face of intermittent connectivity issues.

### Parameters

- `retry_config`: An optional dictionary that specifies parameters for retry behavior. If not provided, the default settings from the project configuration will be utilized.

### Method: `download_model`

#### Purpose

The `download_model` method facilitates the downloading of a specified model while incorporating error handling through retries.

#### Parameters

- `model_name`: The name of the model that is intended to be downloaded.
- `download_fn`: A callable that accepts the model name and performs the downloading action.

#### Usage

This method is crucial for managing model downloads effectively, ensuring that transient errors do not lead to immediate failure during the download process.

#### Example

```python
from embedding_studio.utils.model_download import ModelDownloader

downloader = ModelDownloader()
model = downloader.download_model(
    'my_model',
    download_fn=lambda name: perform_download(name)
)
```

### Motivation

The design of the `ModelDownloader` class is driven by the need for a unified and resilient approach to model downloading, enabling users to recover from temporary failures seamlessly. This functionality is particularly important in environments where network stability is a concern.

### Inheritance

The `ModelDownloader` class inherits directly from Python's base object.
