# Documentation for fine_tuning_worker

## Functionality

The `fine_tuning_worker` function is a Dramatiq task designed to fine-tune an embedding model. It retrieves the fine-tuning task using a specified task ID, validates and prepares the necessary resources, and subsequently executes the fine-tuning process. After completion, it updates the task status based on the outcome and may trigger a reindex task for deployment if required.

## Parameters

- `task_id`: The identifier of the fine-tuning task to be processed.

## Usage

- **Purpose**: The primary objective is to fine-tune an embedding model using details from the specified task.
- **Process**: The function performs the following steps:
  1. Retrieve the fine-tuning task using the `task_id`.
  2. Validate the task and prepare the necessary resources.
  3. Execute the fine-tuning process.
  4. Update the task status according to the outcome.
  5. Optionally, trigger a reindex task if a blue deployment is required.

### Example

```python
import dramatiq
from embedding_studio.workers.fine_tuning.worker import fine_tuning_worker

# Trigger the fine-tuning task
fine_tuning_worker.send("your_task_id_here")
```
