# Documentation for `fine_tuning_mocked_worker`

## Functionality
Simulates a dramatiq task that performs a fine-tuning process for a given task ID. It loads an initial model when necessary, updates the task status, and sets up a fine-tuning iteration using a plugin manager. In case of missing resources or plugins, it raises appropriate exceptions.

## Parameters

- `task_id`: The unique identifier for the fine-tuning task. It is used to retrieve task details and associated model iteration.

## Usage

This worker is designed to simulate a fine-tuning procedure. After retrieving and validating the task, it checks for available plugin capabilities, uploads an initial model if needed, and establishes a new iteration record to proceed with fine-tuning.

### Example

To trigger the fine-tuning simulation for a task with ID "12345":

    fine_tuning_mocked_worker("12345")
