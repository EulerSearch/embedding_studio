## Documentation for `CRUDModelTransferTasks`

### Functionality

CRUDModelTransferTasks manages model transfer tasks in a MongoDB collection. It provides CRUD operations that are specialized for tasks associated with transferring models, using unique model identifiers for both source and destination.

### Main Purposes and Motivation

The class is designed to simplify database operations specific to model transfer tasks. It supports retrieving tasks by embedding model IDs through methods like `get_by_model_id` and `get_by_dst_model_id`. This specialization ensures that data related to model transfers is handled consistently.

### Inheritance

This class inherits from CRUDBase, which provides baseline create, read, update, and delete methods. The inheritance enables us to leverage common operations while customizing behavior for model transfer tasks.

### Usage

- **Purpose**: Manage and operate on model transfer tasks in a MongoDB collection with built-in data validation.

### Methods

#### `CRUDModelTransferTasks.get_by_model_id`

##### Functionality

Retrieves a document from the MongoDB collection using the `embedding_model_id` field. It searches for the document with the provided ID and validates the result using the model's `model_validate` method.

##### Parameters

- `embedding_model_id`: A string or ObjectId representing the model's unique identifier. This parameter is used to query the MongoDB collection.

##### Usage

- **Purpose**: Fetch a document using its embedding model ID and ensure it is valid before further processing.

##### Example

```python
# Example usage
crud_model_transfer_tasks = CRUDModelTransferTasks(
    collection, YourModelClass
)
task = crud_model_transfer_tasks.get_by_model_id("60d5f4839e1d4a3b9c2f9e8a")
if task:
    # Process the retrieved task
    print(task)
else:
    print("Task not found")
```

#### `CRUDModelTransferTasks.get_by_dst_model_id`

##### Functionality

Retrieves a model transfer task from the database using its destination embedding model ID. It validates the returned object against the model schema and returns it if found; otherwise, it returns None.

##### Parameters

- `embedding_model_id`: A string or ObjectId representing the destination embedding model ID to search for.

##### Usage

- **Purpose**: Retrieve and validate a model transfer task from a MongoDB collection using the destination model ID.

##### Example

```python
# Example usage
task = crud_model_transfer_tasks.get_by_dst_model_id("your_destination_model_id")
if task:
    print("Transfer task found!")
else:
    print("Task not found.")
```
