There are not so much services, which do not use filtering in a search, most probably it's almost a search with filters, like e-commerce and real estate services. If it's your case, most probably users are not using filters and trying to use queries like `houses near markets with 3 living rooms`.
So, Embedding Studio can help you too in two ways:

1. Our [Zero-Shot Search queries parser](https://huggingface.co/EmbeddingStudio/query-parser-falcon-7b-instruct), which doesn't need anything except filters schema.
2. With capability of Vector DB and Embedding Studio you can implement query to filters mapper, which will improve session by session.
